For making projects/handson in Docker Compose

## Docker Components:-

Docker Daemon: Background process that builds, runs, and manages containers.

Docker Client: Command-line interface (CLI) used to interact with Docker Daemon, issuing user commands.

Docker Image: Read-only template used to create containers; contains instructions and files.

Docker Container: Runnable instance of an image, isolated from other containers and the host.

Docker Registry: Remote repository to store and distribute Docker images (e.g., Docker Hub).

Docker Host: Machine running the Docker Daemon and containers.

Docker Compose: Tool to define and run multi-container applications using a YAML file.

Docker Swarm: Optional orchestration tool for clustering and managing Docker nodes.

Docker Volume: Persistent storage managed by Docker, allowing containers to read and write data that exists even after the container is removed.

Docker Network: Virtual networks for connecting containers, enabling networking between them
